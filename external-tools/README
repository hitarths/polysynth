  Sketch 1.7.6 README
### PLEASE INSTALL SKETCH HERE


Simple Setup Instructions:
1. Dependencies
Before building you need to have the following tools installed:
bash g++ flex bison

To run sketch you need to install either Java Runtime (JRE) or JDK, at least version 1.5.

2. Building the backend
under the sketch-1.7.6 directory, execute:

cd sketch-backend
chmod +x ./configure
./configure
make
cd ..

Hint: if configure or make keeps complaining, you can try install autoconf and libtool. But usually this is not necessary.

3. Testing the sketch

cd sketch-frontend
chmod +x ./sketch
./sketch test/sk/seq/miniTest1.sk

This should print out the completed sketch.

4. (Optional) setting environment variables
under sketch-frontend directory:

export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`"
export SKETCH_HOME="`pwd`/runtime"

The first one will let you run sketch from anywhere, and the second one will allow the code generators to find the runtime libraries.

5. (Optional) thorough test
If you want to run the completed test suites, run the following commands:
cd test/sk/seq
make long
This will run the complete sketch test suites.
